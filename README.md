# flutter_quizapp

This app was made as a lab project for the class CS 5381 (Cross-Platform App Development) at the University of Texas at El Paso. The objective of this app was to access the professor's server to retrieve the quizzes' data we have done so far in class and make an app with such data. Therefore, we created this app that lets any user with access to the server to select any quiz and answer it, see the score obtained, and review the wrong questions.
